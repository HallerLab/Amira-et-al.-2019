<h1> Integrated microbiota and metabolite profiles identified functional signatures in Crohnâ€™s disease with a link to sulfur metabolism </h1>

<b>     The aim of the study is to identify the potential taxonomic and functional biomarkers that can be associated to Crohn's disease patients. The fecal transfer from one healthy individual, one relapsed patient and one remitted patient were done to murine mouse models (n=3) and metagenomic study was performed from such samples.<p>
        The pipeline presented here is implemented on the metagenomic samples obtained from the murine models (sample size=3 for each disease status). We split the analysis into three parts: <p>
        1. Quality Control <p>
        2. Taxonomic/Functional Profile <p>
        3. Taxonomic/Functional Profile Analysis <p>
        
 <h2> Quality Control </h2>
